# Assignment 4

The assignment was done by myself. Didn't copy any line from other places.

Test case was added under tests folder named new.bats

The arrow sign encode problem still exists, so I can't make the report file. 

Python version is 3.7.6, only package used is numpy. Other two, "copy" and "sys" should be included in default.

Type "python whiless.py" in the console and enter input later will lead to the result. 

The language is same as the last assignment.
